# Car Rentals Website

Welcome to our Car Rentals website! This project was developed by Group 10 as part of the WDDM 115 course. Our goal was to create a user-friendly platform for renting cars, making it convenient for customers to find and book their ideal vehicles.

## Features

- Search and Filter: Users can search for available cars based on criteria such as location, date, and vehicle type. The filtering options allow them to narrow down their choices quickly.

- Car Listings: Detailed listings provide essential information about each car, including make, model, year, price, and availability. High-quality images showcase the vehicles.

- Booking System: Users can reserve a car for specific dates. The system ensures that no double bookings occur.

- Dashboards: Access to a dashboard where they can manage car listings, bookings, and user accounts.
